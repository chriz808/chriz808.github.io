### CPSC 120

Lab 1, part 1

This was one of the labs that I enjoyed most because it was the first time trying/learning the basics. I got to learn the basic needs to be able to write code. I also learned how to use github and all of its commands within this first lab. It was confusing at first but it was really fun learning the basics.

Lab 5 Part 1

This lab was one where we learned how to use different functions and how to link different files with each other. It was interesting to learn that files can interact with each other and how the can build on one another. It was also where loops were needed for the function to work  properly which was a bit confusing at first but once the formula was made it was easy. I liked this lab because it showed that files can work together and it also allowed you to reuse formulas by adding the file into your code. 


Lab 6 Part 1 

I like this lab because it was fun building a program which would help the user build a sandwich. This lab also involved learning how to set limits on your code so that it knows right from wrong. It also was helpful learning you can add restrictions to your code so that it can run properly for the user. Adding restrictions and requirments is needed for the the code/program do it job properly.
